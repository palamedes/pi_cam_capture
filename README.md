This is a simple shell script system that the remote picams will occasionally download in order to know how to capture. 
In theory, this will be pulled via cron every so often.

This is still very much in the prototype phase.

Note; I realize my shell looping method is TERRIBLE.  More over I know that using github this way is dumb.  This is just a POC while I research a better way to do this. =)

For those wonder; "This" is replacing things like my Nest cams with something more affordable. Those things are far too expensive for what you get. (Plus a monthly fee?!  are you kidding me?!)  So my goal here is to create a camera logging system that works in a similar fashion around the Raspberry Pi. In the background it will take photos in a timelapse manner, or better yet, a video stream that it saves somewhere.  Then ultimately you should be able to view a all of your "cams" on one page and click on one to view it in real time (agian, think of any security cam system).
